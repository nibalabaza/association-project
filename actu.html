            Today's technological disciplines responsible for new facility and
            infrastructural projects are now becoming seriously attuned to the
            idea of concern for the physical environment. Certainly, the project
            managers of such projects need to be similarly aware of these
            concerns and manage their projects accordingly. This applies to both
            the project's long term impacts arising out of the project's
            conceptual formulation, as well as its shorter term construction
            impacts arising during execution. However, today's project manager
            also needs to be attuned to the cultural, organizational and social
            environments surrounding the project. Understanding this environment
            includes identifying the project stakeholders and their ability to
            affect its successful outcome. This leads to the possibility of
            influencing this environment in a positive way, for the better
            reception of the change which the project is designed to introduce.
            Thus, the influencable risks involved may be significantly reduced,
            and failure to take such an approach will inevitably lead to a less
            than satisfactory outcome. This chapter discusses various aspects of
            the project environment, and suggests ways in which it may be
            influenced in order to increase the probability of a successful
            outcome. Today's technological disciplines responsible for new
